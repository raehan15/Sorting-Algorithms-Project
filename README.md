# Sorting-Algorithms-Project

Embark on an enlightening journey through the realms of data structures and sorting algorithms with my comprehensive C++ project. This project, a masterpiece of efficient data handling and processing, explores the intersection of hash tables, binary trees, and a variety of sorting techniques, showcasing their unique capabilities and performance benchmarks.

Central to this project is the HashTable class, skillfully designed for effective management of word counts across multiple documents. Through a clever implementation of chaining to resolve collisions, the HashTable ensures robust and efficient data handling. The BinaryTree class complements the HashTable, offering a different approach to data storage and retrieval, and highlighting the contrasting characteristics of these data structures.

The wordItem struct, integral to this project, is meticulously crafted with operator overloads, enabling seamless comparisons and sorting. This plays a pivotal role in the various sorting techniques applied later in the project, including quicksort with different pivot strategies, mergesort, heapsort, and insertionsort. Each sorting method is rigorously tested for performance, revealing insightful data about their execution times and efficiencies.

The project's versatility is further exemplified in its preprocessing stage, where documents are read, and words are extracted, normalized, and stored in both the hash table and binary tree. This dual storage strategy not only demonstrates the project's multifaceted nature but also sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of query processing.

A standout feature of this project is its in-depth performance analysis. The project goes beyond mere implementation, delving into comparative analysis of search and sort efficiencies across different data structures and algorithms. This is achieved through meticulous benchmarking and timing of each method, providing a clear and quantifiable insight into their relative performances.

In summary, this project is not just a demonstration of technical expertise in C++ and data structures, but a deep dive into the practical applications and performance considerations of various algorithms and data structures. It embodies a journey where theory meets practice, offering a rich learning experience and a showcase of algorithmic efficiency in the world of data processing and analysis.
